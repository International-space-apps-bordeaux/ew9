                    The International Space Apps Challenge is an international mass collaboration focused on space exploration that takes place over 48-hours in cities around the world. The event embraces collaborative problem solving with a goal of producing relevant open-source solutions to address global needs applicable to both life on Earth and life in space. This year we have 40 challenges and 25 projects from last year's Space Apps that support NASA's mission directorates in five themes: Earth Watch, Technology in Space, Human Spaceflight, Robotics and Asteroids. NASA is leading this global collaboration along with a number of government collaborators and 100+ local organizations.

                <h3>International</h3>
                <p>
                    The exploration of space is, by necessity, a unified international effort - and diversity of experience and perspective inevitably produces a better product. We are very intentional to make the Space Apps Challenge valuable to and accessible to the international community, and the experience continues to teach us numerous lessons about how to make it more truly international.

                    The Challenge exemplifies the principles of transparency, participation and collaboration by utilizing openly available data, supplied through NASA missions and technology, and the talent and skill of passionate volunteers from around the planet to advance space exploration and improve the quality of life on Earth.

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    The idea of a Challenge is so compelling because it acknowledges the fact that the world is facing serious challenges - and that we all have to work together to approach them. While there are prizes offered for great solutions, the main challenge we focus on is enabling 48 hours of highly engaged collaboration- and discovering what we can create when that happens.
